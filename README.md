Filterable Pagination

$.fn.paginate plugin is a lightweight jQuery plugin that allows you to perform pagination on any list or table. For more details, please see the demos. It requires updating, however, whenever an element is added or removed from the list.

$.fn.paginate also allows you to set which elements to skip or which elements (only) to show in the pagination process.
